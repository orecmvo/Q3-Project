				<h5>Nicole Zefanya</h5>
				<p>NIKI, whose real name is Nicole Zefanya, is born in Jakarta, Indonesia. She is a singer-songwriter whose works are admired by people. During her spare time, she loves gardening and cooking. She has deep love for Indonesian food, that's why everytime she misses her hometown, she simply cooks her favorite Indonesian foods.</p>

				<h5>Other Facts</h5>
				<p>NIKI is in a healthy relationship with Jacob Ray, which is a complete blessing for her. However, it’s somehow a challenge for her to write songs since she’s no longer heartbroken. Additionally, NIKI is an introvert, and therefore it was quite tough for her to be a public figure, where eyes all lay upon her.</p>

				<h5>Passion for Music</h5>
				<p>NIKI had passion for music ever since she was a little kid – she studied music in Lipscomb University at the age of 18 and taught herself to play guitar at the age of 9. She once had a YouTube account named “nzee24” where she shared her talent in singing. The songs that she sang in that account focused on dreams, love, and growing up.</p>

				<h5>What was Music for NIKI?</h5>
				<p>For NIKI, music is not only a job, but it was a crucial part of her life. She also once reached a point in her life that she was contemplating whether she’d continue her passion for music or not. She was uncertain if her Asian parents would support her, especially her dad. After some time, her dad is finally supportive and proud of NIKI for her achievements. According to NIKI, music is a universal language that connects people all over the world. She says that music is greater than herself.</p>

				<h5>NIKI's Discography</h5>
				<p>NIKI's success as a professional singer was only an inside joke between her and her best friends -- it was too impossible. NIKI even told her friends how there was little to no chance of her songs being part of the 88rising channel. But then soon enough, it did. Her songs <strong><em>See U Never & I Like U</em></strong> were one of her top songs that was listened to. To know more about her Discography, click on the "Discography" bar at the Navbar.</p>
